Since Nokia Developer decided to revoke their project hosting services (projects.developer.nokia), I decided to put all my projects (previously hosted on Nokia Developer Projects) on my git hub account.

ABOUT slide-N-make
------------------
slide-N-make is a fun game available for Nokia devices. To play this game you need to select an image and difficulty level to start the game. Based on the difficulty level a 'slide-N-make' puzzle is presented to you. All you are required to do is to arrange the tiles of the image (by sliding) to form the original image, and yes in the minimum moves possible. You may refer to the original image any number of times during the game. You win the game when the original image is formed.

The game ranges from 9 to 25 pieces - with different levels (Easy, Medium and Hard) and a variety of pictures.

ABOUT Qt VERSIONS AND MODULES USED
----------------------------------
The game is developed using Qt SDK by Nokia (Qt 4.7.3). Besides QtGui module, slide-N-make uses the QPixmap and QImage modules to slice images to create puzzles and for the comparison of image slices. It also uses QPropertyAnimation for view switching animations.
